def get_semantic_and_panoptic_label(dataset_info, label, ignore_label):
  """Helper function to get semantic and panoptic label from panoptic label.

  This functions gets the semantic and panoptic label from panoptic label for
  different datasets. The labels must be encoded with semantic_label *
  label_divisor + instance_id. For thing classes, the instance ID 0 is reserved
  for crowd regions. Please note, the returned panoptic label has replaced
  the crowd region with ignore regions. Yet, the semantic label makes use of
  these regions.

  Args:
    dataset_info: A dictionary storing dataset information.
    label: A Tensor of panoptic label.
    ignore_label: An integer specifying the ignore_label.

  Returns:
    semantic_label: A Tensor of semantic segmentation label.
    panoptic_label: A Tensor of panoptic segmentation label, which follows the
      Cityscapes annotation where
      panoptic_label = semantic_label * panoptic_label_divisor + instance_id.
    thing_mask: A boolean Tensor specifying the thing regions. Zero if no thing.
    crowd_region: A boolean Tensor specifying crowd region. Zero if no crowd
      annotation.

  Raises:
    ValueError: An error occurs when the ignore_label is not in range
      [0, label_divisor].
