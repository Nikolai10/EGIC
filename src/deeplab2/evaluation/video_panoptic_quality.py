"""Implementation of the Video Panoptic Quality metric.

Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ) is an instance-based metric for evaluating the task
of video panoptic segmentation.
Please see the paper for details:
Dahun Kim, Sanghyun Woo, Joon-Young Lee, and In So Kweon.
"Video panoptic segmentation." In CVPR, 2020.

Note that our TensorFlow re-implementation of Video Panoptic Quality may give
a bit higher VPQ score than the official numpy implementation
(https://github.com/mcahny/vps).
This re-imeplementation is simply used as an estimate of the prediction
quality during TensorFlow training. The users should convert their video
panoptic prediction to COCO json format and run official numpy implementation,
in order to have a fair comparison with others. See Q4 in our FAQ (g3doc/faq.md)
for more details.

  Dahun Kim, Sanghyun Woo, Joon-Young Lee, and In So Kweon.
  "Video panoptic segmentation." In CVPR, 2020.

  Video Panoptic Quality can be modeled as Image Panoptic Quality with the
  sequences of predictions and the ground-truth labels horizontally concatenated
  as two images, separately. Therefore, this class inherits the image panoptic
  quality class and changes the implementation to concatenated comparisons.
